# skyHealthCheck
This project was created as part of my university coursework. It is a Django web application for Sky employees to complete wellbeing health checks, submit votes, and view summaries based on their role. The repository includes the full code, test plan, an individual report, and a group report covering design, security, and ethical considerations.
